#Command Line Instructions
```bash
$ ls
```
Tells what folders and files are in the current directory.


```bash
$ cd ..
```
Moves up one directory.

```bash
$ cd Me<TAB>
```
changes directory into a sub directory that begins with Me. The tab autocompletes the name of the directory. If there is more than one Me—— directory it does not autocomplete- you must input a unique beginning string. It is caps sensitive.


```bash
$ pwd
```
print working directory. Tells you the name of where you are. I use ls more often.
